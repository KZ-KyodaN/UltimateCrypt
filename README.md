A cipher machine that generates unique keys using multiple data sources, including:  
- Weather data  
- Cryptocurrency prices  
- Stock and currency markets  

## Usage

Run this project locally using VS Code Live Server:
1. Open the project folder in VS Code.
2. Install the **Live Server** extension if you don't have it.
3. Open `index.html` â†’ "Go Live".
4. The app will open in your browser. All keys and logs stay local.
To use, you need to get a free API key from https://twelvedata.com (it's free and easy to use) and add it to `datafetcher.js` on line 1.
Make sure to keep your API key secret and never commit it to a public repo. Check the console for logs and errors while using the app.
# Keep an eye on the console - all logs, key info, and errors will appear there.
